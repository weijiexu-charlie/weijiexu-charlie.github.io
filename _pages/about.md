I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Language Science at University of California, Irvine. I am a member of the [Language Processing Group](https://langprocgroup.github.io/) working with [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/). My area of specialization is psycholinguistics. I am primarily interested in language processing, and how the cognitive mechanisms at the individual level interact with language change and evolution at the population level. To investigate these questions, I draw upon behavioral experiments, corpus analysis, and computational modeling in my research.

Before coming to UC Irvine, I obtained my M.A. in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago, where I worked in the [Language Processing Lab](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/) with [Dr. Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/). Prior to linguistics, I obtained my B.A. in Spanish from Shanghai International Studies University in China.

Born in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province in China, I am a native speaker of both Mandarin Chinese and [Gan Chinese -- Chang-Du (赣语-昌都片)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang-Du_Gan).
