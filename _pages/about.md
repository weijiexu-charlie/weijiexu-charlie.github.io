I am a Ph.D. student in Language Science at University of California, Irvine. I am a member of the [Language Processing Group](https://langprocgroup.github.io/) working with [Dr. Richard Futrell](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/). My area of specialization is computational psycholinguistics. 

Our cognitive system is bounded by considerable constraints, yet remarkably it functions in a seemingly effortless way. My research focuses on human language as a unique window to look into this bounded nature of human mind, aiming to explain **how universal cognitive principles and pressures shape the processing of linguistic signals as well as the learning and formation of linguistic knowledge**:
- *For real-time processing*, the capacity of working memory to retain information is strikingly limited---a perceived linguistic signal is at the risk of being lost, as it is rapidly overwhelmed by the continual torrent of new inputs. My first line of work thus investigates what kinds of representational nature and encoding strategies are adopted by working memory to support an *efficient* use of its limited resources in sentence processing. 
- *For long-term linguistic knowledge*, language users learn a globally coherent linguistic representation from their language experience, but at the same time need to cope with considerable variability across local communicative contexts. My second line of work aims to understand how the linguistic knowledge is dynamically adapted within each individual following some domain-general mechanism, and how those individual-level mechanisms lead to the emergence of linguistic conventions at the population level.

To answer these question, I draw upon computational modeling (e.g., Bayesian modeling, information theory), combined with experimental methods (both behavioral and neural) and large-scale naturalistic data, leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques such as language modeling. I value an interdiscriplinary approach to the study of human language, drawing insights from broader domains of cognitive science (e.g., psychophysics, vision).

Before coming to UC Irvine, I obtained my M.A. in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago, where I worked in the [Language Processing Lab](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/) with [Dr. Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/). Prior to linguistics, I obtained my B.A. in Spanish from Shanghai International Studies University in China.

Born in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province in China, I am a native speaker of both Mandarin Chinese and [Gan Chinese -- Chang-Du (赣语-昌都片)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang-Du_Gan).
